description: I write about eBPF, containers, Kubernetes, and OTel, and journal my daughter Naomi's coding journey here, a nine-year-old with a budding passion for programming. When I'm not working, you'll find me teaching my girls how to code, embarking on long bike trips that sometimes turn into hikes in good weather, playing chess, or enjoying meals and drinks with friends.

  hero__description: I write about Cloud-native Observability, eBPF, Containers, Kubernetes, and OTel. <br>Additionally, I journal my daughter Naomi's coding journey—a nine-year-old with a growing passion for programming. <br><br> When I'm not working, you'll find me teaching my girls how to code, taking long bike trips that sometimes turn into hikes in good weather, playing chess, tinkering with Arduino boards, or enjoying meals and drinks with friends & family. <br><br> I was crazy enough to enrol in an MBA program a while ago. I'm glad it's now over, I graduated with a distinction in MBA Data Analytics. <br><br> I work as a Product Manager and I love data.
