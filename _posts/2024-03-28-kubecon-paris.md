Fantastic week at #KubeCon Paris.

**Key trends:** 
-  The user of AI/GPU demoninated the keynotes
-  OpenTelemetry - The adoption of continuous profiling.  I am super excited about the role  I played in making this happen 
-  WebAssembly - it's potential to enhance application portability 
- Environmental Sustainability, and 
- eBPF for observability and security use cases.

It was amazing to reconnect with industry peers, meet new people, and dive deep into cloud-native advancements.


Even more exciting was sharing my passion for continuous profiling, its adoption in OpenTelemetry, and Elastic's contribution to this progress.

 
My favorite talk was by **John Fastabend and Liz Rice** on eBPF's limitations. While familiar with eBPF's capabilities, I, like many other attendees, was particularly curious to hear their thoughts on its limitations. After all, who better to critique eBPF than the experts who practically wrote it?

Their talk exceeded expectations, including a crash course on Turing completeness and a live demo of Conway's Game of Life â€“ using eBPF!
