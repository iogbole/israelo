### About Me

With over a decade of experience shaping the cloud-native observability landscape, I've honed my skills as a product leader, seamlessly blending deep technical expertise with a relentless focus on customer needs. I've successfully launched multiple products, including six from the ground up, driving substantial revenue growth and addressing customer churn. However, it's through the challenges and missteps that I've gained the most valuable insights, shaping my ability to deliver exceptional products.

Currently at Elastic, I'm leading a multi-faceted charter: 

-   **Elastic Universal Profiling:** This **eBPF**-based profiling solution was quite the journey! I joined the team shortly after Elastic acquired optimyze.cloud. My mission? Find product-market fit for "prodfiler," integrate it with the Elastic stack, launch it publicly, and open-source it. The cherry on top? Contributing it to the OpenTelemetry project. Leading a team of successful founders as PM, I helped build trust, achieve milestones, and witness the power of open-source collaboration. Launching, open-sourcing, and contributing to OTel – that takes some serious product know-how!
-   **eBPF Kubernetes Observability:** Think "pixie project" on steroids! Leading the product charter for this solution, we're auto-discovering L4 connectivity, metering it like Cilium Hubble, aggregating L7 traffic, and seamlessly integrating with OTel – all while automatically including and correlating profiling signals. We're even building towards automatic language app instrumentation. This means customers get a faster time-to-value with automatic insights, ditching the manual setup struggles they face today.
-   **BI and Telemetry:** Let's talk data! I passionately advocated for the lack of data impacting critical business and product decisions. Guess what? I got tasked with fixing it! Assembling a data-loving team, we set a clear strategy and goal: "know our customers" by centralizing data insights, mining inferences, and identifying patterns. My role as PM was clear: paint a picture of the future and why we should reach for it. The team grew from 2 to 5, with external talent joining the internal crew. We're fueled by the power of data-driven decision making!
-   **Cloud Observability (New!):** Since July 2024, I begun PM-leading Cloud Observability. My mission? Making it ridiculously easy for customers to ingest logs, metrics, and traces from AWS, Azure, and GCP. While the Elastic Agent approach exists, my immediate focus is driving the agentless, push-based approach using solutions like AWS Firehose, Cloudwatch metrics, and GCP Dataflow. But most importantly, I keep reminding the team that our job doesn't end at data ingestion. Defining how customers use data to unlock insights is paramount!

Prior to my current role at Elastic, I was an Engineering Product Manager at **Cisco AppDynamics**.

I started as the Product Manager for Cloud-Native Observability, which became the very first feature to launch with the release of AppDynamics Cloud (which was later rebranded to Cisco Observability Cloud). I also expanded my charter into **tagging**. This was a challenging task, as it required collaboration across teams, cross-PMs, and platforms to execute the ingestion of tags and labels from Kubernetes, cloud services, and even custom tags. I defined how customers could use this powerful tool to find the "needle in the haystack." 

Prior to becoming a PM at AppDynamics, I was a Solutions Architect, focusing on presales (Q3-Q4) and post-sales (mostly Q1-Q2).  

I thrive in fast-paced environments, collaborating closely with engineering, design, and marketing teams to deliver exceptional products. My journey from software engineer to product leader gives me a unique perspective, enabling me to bridge the gap between technical complexity and business impact.
